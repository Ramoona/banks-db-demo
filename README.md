### [Demo](https://ramoona.github.io/banks-db-demo/)
You can get bank name and brand color by [IIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_card_number#Issuer_identification_number_(IIN)) — first 4-6 digits of a card number. For example, `539123` gives you `Revolut` bank's data.

You can also get a card issuer like Visa or Mastercard by entering the full (12-16 digits) card number. But don't worry, there's no need to use your real card, you can replace all digits starting from 7th with any other digit like 0. For example, `4003 6100 0000 0000` is detected as `Visa`.

🙅🏻‍♀️Banks DB demo page **does not** collect card numbers or use them in any other way.
